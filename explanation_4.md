We check if a user is in the list `users` of the group, and if the group has any sub-group, we check if a user is in the list `users` of the sub-group as well. The pattern repeats so we can use `recursion`. The **time complexity** and **space complexity** will be O(n), for n is the total number of users in the main group and subgroups.
